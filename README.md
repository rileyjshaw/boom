This is an unpublished Chrome extension that I found on an old hard drive. I might write a proper README for it someday.

## Usage
Click the bomb icon. The fuse should light. At this point, you can:

 - Hold **d** and click elements to delete them.
 - Hold **b** and click text elements to make them more readable.

Hitting **escape** or clicking the bomb icon again defuses the extension.

The keybindings are unnecessary, really. I'll get rid of them if I ever put this on the Chrome store :bomb:
