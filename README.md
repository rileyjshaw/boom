## Sound cool?
Get it on [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/boom-readability/) or [Chrome](https://goo.gl/Jjyid5).

## Usage
Click the bomb icon. The fuse should light. At this point, you can:

- Click elements to delete them.
- Hold **shift** and click text elements to make them more readable.

Hitting **escape** or clicking the bomb icon again defuses the extension.

You can toggle boom! with a hotkey by going to Tools -> Extensions and clicking the "Keyboard shortcuts" link at the bottom.
